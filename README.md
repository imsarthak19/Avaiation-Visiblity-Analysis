# Avaiation-Visiblity-Analysis
A data-driven project analyzing fog and low-visibility patterns in the Delhi-NCR region using aviation-grade METAR data from IGI Airport, with planned expansion to Hindon and Noida International Airport for broader regional analysis.


This project is focused on studying fog and low-visibility patterns in the Delhi-NCR region using highly reliable airport ATC/ATAC METAR data. The initial analysis is based on Indira Gandhi International Airport (VIDP), leveraging aviation-grade weather observations to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The project is being developed with the intent to expand the dataset to additional regional airports, such as Hindon Airport and the upcoming Noida International Airport (Jewar), enabling broader spatial comparison and strengthening the reliability of the findings.

By using structured parsing and analytical techniques on real-world aviation weather data, this project aims to provide objective, data-driven insights into fog behavior, particularly during critical early-morning operational hours in North India.
